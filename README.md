# interactive-maps
Displays categorized locations on a map using pandas and plotly.

You'll also need to scrape data youre interested in mapping.


You'll need the following;
    - Mapbox public key to execute interactive-maps-2.
    - Location (lat, lon).
    - Type (Area, Food/Drinks, Transportation, Lodging, Misc).
    - Name of Place.
    - Place the data in a csv file with the following format:
          -ex. (1, World Bar, -33.8832,151.2240,Food/Drinks).
    - Import pandas and plotly.

# Note:
    - interactive-maps-3 scrapes the most mentioned locations in local blogs to determine popularity.
    - Thus, you must scraped names of locations mentioned in blogs and place them in a .csv file.
    - I suggest scraping multiple local blogs for more accurate data.
